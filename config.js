We honestly thought we'd be lifetime renters—that homeownership just wasn't in the cards for us. Rick walked us through every single step of the process and made it all make sense. His negotiation skills are incredible. He got us this home for way less than we thought possible, and now instead of paying rent, we're building equity and have the potential to become landlords ourselves with the basement income. We couldn't have done this without him.\"\"<br><span>— Satisfied Client</span>"
